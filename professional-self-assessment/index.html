                    <!-- Professional Assessment Text -->
                    <p>
                        Completing the Computer Science program and developing this ePortfolio provided a structured way to identify my technical strengths, refine my professional goals, and establish values essential for a career in technology. Through a fully online learning environment, I gained hands-on experience in programming, problem-solving, and system design while also strengthening written communication, technical documentation, and independent problem analysis. This combination has prepared me to enter the computer science field with confidence and adaptability.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        While the program did not include traditional team-based projects, collaboration was emphasized through structured discussion posts and mock company projects, particularly in CS 250 Software Development Lifecycle and CS 255 System Analysis and Design. These courses required me to evaluate peer perspectives, respond constructively to feedback, and approach problems from multiple stakeholder viewpoints. This experience strengthened my ability to work within structured development processes and align technical decisions with business and user needs.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Communication with stakeholders was a consistent focus across coursework. I developed the ability to explain technical concepts clearly to non-technical audiences through design documentation, written justifications, and project presentations. Courses such as CS 305 Software Security and CS 320 Software Test, Automation QA required me to articulate design trade-offs, testing strategies, and security considerations in a professional and accessible manner.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        My foundation in data structures and algorithms was developed through CS 300 Data Structures and Algorithms: Analysis and Design, where I applied lists, maps, trees, and algorithmic techniques for sorting, searching, and performance optimization. These skills enable me to design scalable, maintainable systems and evaluate efficiency trade-offs when developing software solutions.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Software engineering and database concepts were reinforced through courses such as DAD 220 Intro to Structured Database Environments and CS 340 Client/Server Development. I gained experience in object-oriented design, modular architecture, database schema design, CRUD operations, and front-end and back-end integration, emphasizing maintainability and reliability in application development.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Security considerations were integrated throughout the program, particularly in CS 305 Software Security, where I implemented authentication workflows, secure data handling practices, and access controls. This coursework strengthened my awareness of common vulnerabilities and reinforced the importance of building secure, trustworthy systems from the design phase forward.
                    </p>

                    <h3>What to Expect:</h3>

                    <p>
                        This portfolio presents a series of technical artifacts that collectively demonstrate my skills and experience in computer science. Each artifact represents a deliberate enhancement to my original Weight Tracker application, highlighting both my technical growth and my ability to evaluate, refine, and expand existing software systems.
                    </p>

                    <!-- Enhancement One -->
                    <div class="enhancement">
                        <h3>Enhancement One – Weight Trend Graph</h3>
                        <p>
                            Enhancement One introduces a weight trend graph that allows users to visualize historical weight data over time. This enhancement demonstrates my ability to transform raw data into meaningful, user-friendly visual representations. Through this process, I applied principles of data handling, visualization techniques, and interface design to ensure the feature is intuitive, informative, and responsive.
