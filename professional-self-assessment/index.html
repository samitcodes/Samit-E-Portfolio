                    <p>
                        Completing the Computer Science program and developing this ePortfolio has provided a structured path to showcase my strengths, clarify my professional goals, and develop values essential for a successful career in technology. Through rigorous coursework and project-based learning, I have gained practical experience in programming, problem-solving, and system design while also enhancing collaboration, communication, and security awareness. This foundation has prepared me to enter the computer science field with confidence and employability.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Collaborating in a team environment was central to many of my courses, including CS 250 Software Development Lifecycle and CS 255 System Analysis and Design, where I participated in group projects that required coordinated planning, version control management, and peer code review. These experiences strengthened my ability to work effectively in diverse teams, resolve conflicts constructively, and integrate individual contributions into cohesive software solutions.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Communicating with stakeholders was emphasized throughout the program. I learned to translate technical concepts into clear, actionable information for non-technical audiences, including project sponsors and instructors. Courses such as CS 305 Software Security and CS 320 Software Test, Automation QA required me to document design decisions, explain trade-offs, and present technical solutions in a professional manner, which enhanced my ability to articulate complex ideas with clarity.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        My coursework in CS 300 Data Structures and Algorithms: Analysis and Design provided a strong foundation in problem-solving and algorithmic thinking. I developed expertise in data structures such as lists, maps, and trees, and applied efficient algorithms for sorting, searching, and optimizing performance. These skills enable me to design scalable, maintainable systems and evaluate computational trade-offs critically.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Software engineering principles and database management were emphasized in courses such as DAD 220 Intro to Structured Database Environments and CS 340 Client/Server Development. I gained experience in object-oriented design, modular architecture, database schema creation, CRUD operations, and integrating front-end and back-end systems. These experiences taught me how to design maintainable, efficient, and reliable software applications.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Security was a consistent focus across the curriculum, particularly in CS 305 Software Security, where I learned to implement authentication workflows, secure data handling, and access controls. Understanding common vulnerabilities and mitigation strategies has shaped my approach to building resilient and trustworthy systems.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Beyond my ePortfolio artifacts, I further developed my skills through electives and prior learning experiences, including CS 319 UI/UX Design and Development, DAT 325 Data Validation: Quality/Cleaning, DAT 375 Data Analysis Techniques, and IT 355 Web and Mobile User Experience. These experiences enhanced my ability to deliver high-quality, user-focused software and perform thorough data analysis.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Overall, completing the program and developing this ePortfolio has equipped me with a broad and practical skill set in computer science, from collaborative software development and stakeholder communication to algorithm design, software engineering, database management, and security. These experiences collectively showcase my technical competence, professional readiness, and capacity to contribute effectively in a variety of computing environments.
                    </p>

                    <!-- Original Enhancement Sections -->
                    <div class="enhancement">
                        <h3>Enhancement One – Weight Trend Graph</h3>
                        <p>
                            Enhancement One features a weight trend graph, which allows users to visualize historical weight data over time. This demonstrates my ability to convert raw data into meaningful, actionable insights through clear and intuitive visualizations. By implementing graphing functionality, I applied knowledge of data structures, plotting libraries, and dynamic user interfaces, ensuring the feature is responsive and user-friendly.
