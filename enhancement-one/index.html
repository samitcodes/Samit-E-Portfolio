                    <h2>Enhancement One: Weight Trend Graph</h2>
                </header>

                <p>
                    The artifact I have chosen for my ePortfolio is a mobile Weight Tracker application developed 
                    as part of my CS360 coursework. This application allows users to manage their weight over time 
                    by adding, updating, or removing entries through a simple, intuitive interface. The original version 
                    focused on establishing reliable CRUD functionality, providing a foundation for enhancements that 
                    improve both usability and functionality.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I included this artifact because it demonstrates my technical skills in mobile application development, 
                    problem-solving, and creating practical solutions for real-world challenges. A key enhancement I implemented 
                    was the integration of a <strong>weight trend graph</strong>, which visually displays the user’s weight changes 
                    over time. This transformed the app from a static data-entry system into a dynamic tool that allows users 
                    to monitor progress and trends effectively. Implementing this feature required evaluating charting libraries, 
                    adapting to platform-specific limitations, and learning to integrate third-party tools.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The following snippet demonstrates how I prepared and bound the dataset to the chart using MPAndroidChart, 
                    enabling real-time visualization of user weight entries:
                </p>

                <pre><code class="language-java">
// Prepare data entries for the chart
ArrayList<Entry> entries = new ArrayList<>();
for (int i = 0; i < weights.size(); i++) {
    entries.add(new Entry(i, (float) weights.get(i)));
}

// Create and style the dataset
LineDataSet dataSet = new LineDataSet(entries, "Weight Progress");
dataSet.setColor(getResources().getColor(R.color.purple_500));
dataSet.setLineWidth(2f);
dataSet.setCircleRadius(4f);

// Bind data to the chart and refresh
LineData lineData = new LineData(dataSet);
weightChart.setData(lineData);
weightChart.invalidate();
                </code></pre>

                <p>
                    This enhancement required addressing several challenges, including ensuring real-time updates 
                    as new weight entries were added, formatting X-axis labels for readability, and overcoming initial 
                    incompatibility issues with Chart.js. Through independent research, iterative testing, and consultation 
                    of MPAndroidChart documentation, I successfully integrated the chart, creating a responsive and user-friendly interface. 
                    Peer feedback during testing helped refine the graph’s clarity and overall usability.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Through this process, I strengthened my skills in data visualization, UI design, integration of external libraries, 
                    and problem-solving. The enhancement allowed me to fully meet course outcomes related to professional communication 
                    through visual and technical forms and the application of new methods and technologies to solve computing problems. 
                    While some outcomes, such as advanced algorithmic analysis, remain to be addressed in future enhancements, this artifact 
                    demonstrates my ability to independently learn new tools, apply them practically, and add meaningful value to a software application.
